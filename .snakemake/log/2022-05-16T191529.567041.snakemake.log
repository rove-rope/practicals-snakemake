Building DAG of jobs...
Relative file path './data/adapters.fa' starts with './'. This is redundant and strongly discouraged. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake. You can simply omit the './' for relative file paths.

This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
